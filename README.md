# Audapter C++ MEX Code
Audapter: Real-time speech signal perturbation (formant frequencies, pitch, timing and intensity). This is the MEX core of the MATLAB package.

## Setting up Audapter
If you only want to RUN Audapter, the .mex file is the only file you need. Just put it somewhere on your Matlab path. See the ["Releases" section of the GitHub page](https://github.com/blab-lab/audapter_mex/releases) for the compiled .mex file.

If you want to MAKE PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES to Audapter, you can download this whole repository and work with the C++ code.
